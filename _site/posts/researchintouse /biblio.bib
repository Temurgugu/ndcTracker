   abstract = {We live in an interconnected world. Multi-source, decentralised information-sharing and cooperation systems are becoming ever more important in all areas of social, economic and cultural life. The Covenant of Mayors for local sustainable energy is a very concrete demonstration of this trend. Its story started in 2008, when-after the adoption of the EU climate and energy package-the European Commission decided to directly involve municipalities in reaching the 2020 objectives. By committing to the Covenant, an initial group of some 300 mayors voluntarily undertook to adopt a sustainable energy action plan (SEAP), rethinking the way their city operates and bringing them closer to energy self-suffi ciency, with measures favouring local economic development and improving citizens' quality of life. Just a few years later, the Covenant extended to thousands of local authorities-including almost all EU capitals-and an increasing number of stakeholders, establishing itself as one of the most emblematic examples of multi-level governance and bottom-up action in Europe.},

   abstract = {Supported by This solution was compiled through a grant from Google.org to guide local governments on "How to effectively work with local stakeholders" in the framework of a series of activities that aim to help local governments demystify the process of translating data into climate action, resulting in cities across the globe developing more strategic and more effective climate change mitigation projects. DISCLAIMER All cities are unique. The Solution provides guidance on general conditions, which may not correspond to the existing conditions in your city or jurisdiction. The consultation and use of this solution does not waive the need for the Local Government to assess the feasibility in the local context in its city or jurisdiction, prior to implementation. Please note that the impacts, benefits, and co-benefits indicated are generally valid but may not materialize in particular circumstances. ABOUT SOLUTIONS GATEWAY Solutions Gateway in an online resource platform for Local Governments where they will be able to find possible Low Emissions Development (LED) Solutions for their cities. In the context of the Solutions Gateway, Solutions are processes, or groups of actions, which Local Governments can implement to deliver climate change mitigation results and enhance local sustainable development. Taking an integrated approach, and focusing on Local Governments usual responsibilities and roles, Solutions include core actions as well as enabling and multiplying actions essential to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency. These include policy, regulatory, governance, capacity building, awareness raising, stakeholder engagement, etc. ABOUT ICLEI-LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability is a global network working with more than 2,500 local and regional governments committed to sustainable urban development. Active in 125+ countries, ICLEI influences sustainability policy and drives local action for low emission, nature-based, equitable, resilient and circular development. ICLEI's Members and team of experts work together through peer exchange, partnerships and capacity building to create systemic change for urban sustainability.

   abstract = {Cities and local authorities are key players in addressing climate change. The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy in the European Eastern Partnership countries (CoM EAST) is an active initiative that continues to raise interest. The initiative covers six countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine) and counts more than 400 signatories who are committed to tackle climate change's causes and impacts in their territories, through the implementation of local actions. This study provides an overview and assesses CoM EAST signatories commitments and plans, examines planned and implemented policies, covering both mitigation and adaptation pillars of the initiative for the first time in the region.},

   abstract = {Cities and local authorities are key players in implementing the clean energy transition and addressing climate change. Since 2008, the European Commission endorses and supports their efforts through the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (CoM) and notably through the provision of capacity building, technical assistance, sharing of best practices and peer learning opportunities. This support is in line with the European Green Deal, the European Union (EU) strategy to cut emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and to reach climate neutrality by 2050 while creating jobs and growth. The initiative helps consolidate practices to monitor and report on energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as on risks and vulnerabilities at the local level, allowing decision-makers to identify priority sectors, set emission reduction targets and climate change adaptation goals and plan relevant measures. This report provides a scientific assessment of the CoM pillars of climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on data reported through the MyCovenant reporting platform. It describes the Covenant community, the plans submitted by signatories, examines actions and measures and gives an overview on the progress made on emission reduction comparing baseline and monitoring emission inventories. The key findings on mitigation show that the overall commitment to reducing GHG emissions by signatories is 25.7% by 2020 and 44.5% by 2030 compared to baseline emissions. Looking at a subset of action plans with a 2020 time horizon from cities in EU-27 that also reported at least one monitoring emission inventory, on average GHG emissions were reduced by 26.1% between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, looking at a subset of action plans with a 2030 timeline from cities in EU-27 which submitted a monitoring emission inventory, the forecast on expected achievements is not so optimistic, as their monitoring reports allow predicting a 37.8% reduction by 2030 (against 46.6% targeted reduction). On adaptation to climate change, while committed signatories and adaptation action plans remain less numerous than mitigation ones, trends are very positive and figures are constantly growing. For example, considering the reported adaptation actions by year (2010-2020), the numbers are increasing at an exponential rate (from about 100 actions with 2014 as starting year, to over 3200 with 2020 as starting year), and the trend is projected to continue. The hazards reported the most in EU cities are floods & sea level rise, heavy precipitation, wildfires and extreme heat. The most-reported vulnerable sectors are agriculture & forestry, civil protection & emergency, environment & biodiversity, and health. Data shows potential incoherencies or "gaps" among the reported hazards and the hazards most addressed by actions.},
