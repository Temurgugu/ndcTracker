      "contents": "\nIn July 2021, Georgia has launched the project on “Tracing the Link\nBetween Climate Justice Action and the NDCs,” which is already being\nimplemented in Brazil, Columbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Germany.\nSince the International climate commitments are translated into\nnational plans and strategies, resulting in local climate actions, the\nproject’s primary goal is to assess how well the NDC-ETF Framework\nallows for tracking local climate action in their respective capacities\nand capabilities and whether it helps or hinders energy access and\nclimate just renewable energy systems. Thus, the case study will report\non the following objectives:\nThe traceability/translation of international climate commitments to\nnational and local climate plans;\nAuthorities’ consistency in reporting on the implementation of local\nand national climate plans;\nAuthorities report on the effects of the implementation of local and\nnational climate action;\nThe traceability/recognition and contribution of the of\ncommunity-based renewable energy projects.\nThis project is part of the International\nClimate Initiative (IKI). The\nFederal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear\nSafety (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision\nadopted by the German Bundestag. The study is commissioned by Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland\ne.V. (BUND).\n\n\n\n",
