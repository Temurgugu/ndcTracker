The project team developed visualization as a side project based on the 2021-2023 Action Plan of Georgiaâ€™s 2030 Climate Strategy. The interactive visualization explores responsible institutions for the action plan activities and shows how activities are supported and by how much. 

Some of the findings you can see [here](https://ndctracker.netlify.app/posts/ndctracker/); rest expore by yourself and share with us.
