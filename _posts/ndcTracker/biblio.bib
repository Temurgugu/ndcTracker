@article{Rajamani2000,
abstract = {Global climate change may well be the most significant environmental problem of our time. It is significant, not just for its portended consequences, which are severe, but also for its ability to test the extent of humankind's collective conscience to take moral responsibility for a problem of its own making. If the ongoing international negotiations are any indication, the world community is yet to come of age. Since its inception, the climate negotiations have witnessed intense bickering between and within the industrial and developing world over who should take responsibility, in what measure, and under what conditions, to avert climate change. Of late the long-existent differences between countries have converged on the notion of meaningful participation for developing countries. Whilst the US has refused to take on binding obligations until 'key developing nations meaningfully participate',1 the G-77/China, the UN developing country alliance, has refused to accept 'new commitments under any guise'.2 The inability of the international community to deal with this conflict in an equitable manner has resulted in a loss of momentum that could jeopardize the two critical determinants of an effective climate regime: universal participation and timeliness in achieving the necessary international cooperation. This paper explores the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, enshrined, inter alia, in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, with a view to enriching the debate on meaningful participation of developing countries. It aims to carve out a role for developing countries within the climate regime commensurate with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.},

We analyse the Khudoni Hydroelectric Power Plant in the Svaneti region of Georgia, which was halted in 2013 after much social protest. We assess why the project lacked a SLO and what lessons can be learnt from this experience. Using the Thomson and Boutilier model of SLO as our analytical framework, we elaborate its key elements – legitimacy, credibility and trust – in the context of dam and hydropower projects and assess where the Khudoni project failed. We conclude that the project lacked legitimacy, with local communities not seeing any social justification for the project. The credibility of the project and proponent was weak amongst the local population, and trust was absent at all phases of the project. We conclude that the concept of social licence to operate has the potential to encourage project proponents to consider and implement activities which will lead to better outcomes for all parties. We believe there is a strong business case for companies to take the concept seriously. Improving social performance will assist projects in gaining a social licence to operate and grow.},

@article{Reed2009,
abstract = {Stakeholder analysis means many things to different people. Various methods and approaches have been developed in different fields for different purposes, leading to confusion over the concept and practice of stakeholder analysis. This paper asks how and why stakeholder analysis should be conducted for participatory natural resource management research. This is achieved by reviewing the development of stakeholder analysis in business management, development and natural resource management. The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. These case studies show the wide range of participatory and non-participatory methods that can be used, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of existing methods for stakeholder analysis. The case studies also propose new tools and combinations of methods that can more effectively identify and categorise stakeholders and help understand their inter-relationships. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In reducing the mutual risks, all nations should “cooperate in a spirit of global partnership.” Responsibilities are said to be “differentiated,” however, in that not all countries should contribute equally.

abstract = {[A considerable challenge for the creators of international environmental agreements is how to design mechanisms that deter defection without deterring participation. Relatively "soft" law often garners widespread participation, but it creates few concrete incentives for states to improve behavior. "Harder" commitments make shirking more difficult, but these institutional features may deter from joining the very states whose practices are least consistent with the treaty's requirements. Empirical analyses of ratification of the core agreements of the climate change regime support these propositions. Flexibility provisions provide one mechanism for states to mitigate this dilemma. The findings with regard to one flexibility mechanism strongly support this argument. The results with regard to a second flexibility mechanism, however, tend to follow an opposite pattern. The author offers a preliminary interpretation of this finding. Finally, this article provides insight into how international social networks and the strength of domestic nongovernmental organizations affect ratification.]},

   abstract = {Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted, and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches, and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues, we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation, and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.},
